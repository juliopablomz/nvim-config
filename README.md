# nvim-config
This repository contains my **Neovim** configuration that I'm using at the moment.

## Installation
First, download the dependencies (if you don't have them), and then 
follow the installation steps below.

### Dependencies
>[!NOTE]
> I use Linux, so I configured it for Linux. I don't guarantee (and don't recommend) using this configuration outside of a Linux environment.

* **curl**
* **neovim** *(>= v0.11.0)*
* **vim-plug** *([manually install this plugin in your neovim](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug))*

### Manual installation
Download the files from the repository and extract them to `~/.config/nvim/`, or any 
other directory you use.

Then run **nvim** and type the command `:PlugInstall`. Everything should be working.
